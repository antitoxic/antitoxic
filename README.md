### Hi there üëã

I have
[some open source projects looking for funding](https://github.com/antitoxic?tab=repositories)
üòá but otherwise:

- üí¨ **Ask me** about:
  - **Composable UI/Frontend** project architecture
  - **Achievable upgrades & migrations** of legacy codebases (_living with different tech stacks and transitioning from one to another_)
  - **DevX** (_developer experience_)
  - UI/Frontend **project setup** (_from scratch, w/o using generators like CRA_)
  - **TypeScript** & build process in general
  - **Micro-frontends** & **Module federation**
  - **monorepo** management (_even for projects with different runtimes_)
  - **Visual** testing (_doing it right is not easy_)
  - [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) (_it's not dead!_)
  - **React**
  ‚Äî **State management**: (_all of observables, reactive state, serializable stores, ..._)
  - civic hacking
  - [Sanity.js](https://www.sanity.io/)
- ‚ù§Ô∏è I **enjoy** making good software and a mix of japandi+mediterranean
  interior design.
- üéØ My **focus** is making things simpler, understandable, minimalistic,
  reusable; **while not requiring product development to stop**.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to **collaborate** on starting local small businesses
- üì´ **Reach me** @ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonstoychev/)
  (_since I don't use other social networks_)

### ‚öñÔ∏è My Core Principles in Software development
- Tools & frameworks are coming and going all the time, what's eternal is **the need to move from one version to another or one tool to another**
- The way to **avoid a dying codebase is to make it composable** and its pieces **swappable**
- Developers should have **direct access to configure the underlyng tools** used in their development, not to be hidden through layers of abstractions and meta-configuration
- Developers must be aware of **what their project dependencies mean** for the final code they deploy
- **Code editors are first-class runtime environments for tools** & we need to care about them
- A big part of advancing technical skills is understanding the underlying platforms, their capabilities & limitations
- A big part of being a good developer is caring about how well can your code be understood, edited & debugged by others
- A big part of any job is to understand others & share a common goal
- Companies developing software should have a **common shared foundation** all their teams build upon, but individual teams should have **control over their project-specific needs**
- `JSON` **is a terrible configuration format**.
  - `TypeScript` is the ideal format to deliver suggestions, type checking & good code editor integration with documentation hints.
  - Explain your configuration with comments
  - Prefer `.mjs` with `jsdoc` comments when `.ts` is not an option (_but think why `.ts` is not?_)
  - Prefer `.cjs` with `jsdoc` comments when `.mjs` is not an option (_but think why `.ts` is not?_)
  - If there really isn't a way not to use anything else but `JSON`, then use json schema to validate it and enforce it using a tool like `eslint` that has good code editor support
- AI is just another integration point: platform/runtime/tool.
