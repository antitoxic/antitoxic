### Hi there 👋

I have
[some open source projects looking for funding](https://github.com/antitoxic?tab=repositories)
😇 but otherwise:

- 💬 **Ask me** about: TypeScript, UI project architecture, FE project setup
  (_from scratch, w/o using generators like CRA_),
  [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/), monorepo management, civic hacking, React,
  observables, [Sanity.js](https://www.sanity.io/)
- ❤️ I **enjoy** making good software and a mix of japandi+mediterranean
  interior design.
- 🎯 My **focus** is making things simpler, understandable, minimalistic,
  reusable
- 👯 I’m looking to **collaborate** on starting local small businesses
- 📫 **Reach me** @ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonstoychev/)
  (_since I don't use other social networks_)
